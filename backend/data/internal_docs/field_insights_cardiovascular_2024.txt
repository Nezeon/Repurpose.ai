Field Insights: Cardiovascular Market - Q4 2024

Regional Performance:
- North America: SGLT2 inhibitors gaining traction beyond diabetes, now 40% of scripts for heart failure
- Europe: ESC guidelines update driving Entresto adoption, +25% QoQ growth
- Asia-Pacific: Generic statins dominate, but PCSK9i penetration below 2% despite high CVD burden

Competitor Intelligence:
- Novo Nordisk's semaglutide: Cardiologists prescribing off-label for CV risk reduction
- Amgen's Repatha: Struggling with payer pushback despite FOURIER trial data
- Boehringer's Jardiance: Filed for expansion into CKD indication, expected approval Q1 2025

Physician Feedback:
- "We need more affordable lipid-lowering options beyond statins. PCSK9 inhibitors are clinically effective but commercially unviable for most patients."
- "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is underserved. Only Entresto showing promise, but we need more options."
- "Digital health integration is critical. Patients want smart monitoring, not just pills."

Unmet Needs:
1. Affordable PCSK9 alternatives or biosimilars
2. HFpEF therapies with diverse mechanisms of action
3. Combination therapies for polypharmacy reduction
4. Long-acting formulations for adherence improvement

Market Opportunity:
- HFpEF: $8B global market, 8% CAGR (2024-2029)
- PCSK9 biosimilars: $2B opportunity if priced below $200/month
- Digital therapeutics combined with pharma: Emerging, high payer interest
- Repurposing potential: Metformin for CV protection, Colchicine for post-MI inflammation

Key Data Points:
- Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally (17.9M deaths/year)
- Heart failure prevalence: 64 million people worldwide
- Annual cost of CVD in the US: $363 billion (2021 data, projected to reach $490B by 2030)
- Generic penetration in lipid-lowering: 87% by volume, but only 45% by revenue
