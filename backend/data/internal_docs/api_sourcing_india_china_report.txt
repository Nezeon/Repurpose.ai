API Sourcing and EXIM Analysis: India vs China Strategy
Date: December 2024

Executive Summary:
India and China account for 70% of global API supply. Recent geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions are driving diversification. Key trend: "China Plus One" policy by Western pharma companies.

India API Market Overview:
- Market size: $6.5B (2023), 10% CAGR expected through 2028
- Strengths: Cost-competitive, strong regulatory expertise (US FDA, EMA), English proficiency
- Weaknesses: Infrastructure gaps (power, logistics), limited scale for commodity APIs
- Key players: Sun Pharma API, Aurobindo, Laurus Labs, Divis Laboratories

China API Market Overview:
- Market size: $45B (2023), 8% CAGR
- Strengths: Scale, vertical integration, strong chemistry capabilities
- Weaknesses: Regulatory scrutiny (FDA warning letters), environmental concerns, IP risks
- Key players: Zhejiang Medicine, CSPC Pharma, Huahai, Tianyu Pharma

API Categories and Sourcing Strategy:

Commodity APIs (High Volume, Low Margin):
- Examples: Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Metformin, Aspirin
- Current sourcing: 80% China, 20% India
- Strategy: Dual-source for supply security, China remains primary

Specialty APIs (Complex Chemistry, Higher Margin):
- Examples: Losartan, Atorvastatin, Amlodipine, Sertraline
- Current sourcing: 50% China, 35% India, 15% EU/US
- Strategy: India-first for new programs, China as cost alternative

High-Potency APIs (HPAPIs):
- Examples: Oncology APIs (Paclitaxel, Lenalidomide)
- Current sourcing: 40% China, 30% India, 30% EU/US
- Strategy: Prefer India/EU for US/EU markets; China for emerging markets

EXIM Data Highlights (2023):

Top 5 APIs Imported to US from India:
1. Gabapentin: $120M (+15% year-over-year)
2. Lamotrigine: $95M (+8% YoY)
3. Losartan Potassium: $85M (+12% YoY)
4. Montelukast Sodium: $78M (+20% YoY) - Patent expiry driving volume
5. Ciprofloxacin: $65M (-5% YoY) - Mature, declining

Top 5 APIs Imported to US from China:
1. Paracetamol: $450M (+3% YoY)
2. Ibuprofen: $380M (+1% YoY)
3. Vitamin C: $310M (+5% YoY)
4. Penicillin G: $240M (-2% YoY)
5. Heparin Sodium: $210M (+8% YoY)

Regulatory Landscape:
- FDA inspections: India (125 facilities inspected 2023), China (45 facilities)
- Warning letters: China (18 in 2023), India (12) - both improving
- Drug shortages: 35% attributed to API supply chain issues (2023)

Cost Benchmarking (Example: Losartan Potassium):
- China: $85/kg (baseline)
- India: $95/kg (+12% premium)
- EU: $140/kg (+65% premium)
- US: $180/kg (+112% premium)

Emerging Trends:
1. Green Chemistry: India investing in sustainable manufacturing
2. Backward Integration: Indian companies securing intermediates from China
3. CDMO Growth: China's WuXi AppTec, India's Sai Life Sciences - integrated services
4. Technology Transfer: Chinese companies licensing processes to Indian partners

Strategic Recommendations:
1. Diversify: Minimum dual-source for all critical APIs (never 100% single country)
2. Visit and Audit: Quarterly site visits to top suppliers, real-time quality monitoring
3. Regulatory Engagement: Collaborate with FDA/EMA on supply chain transparency
4. Long-term Contracts: Lock in pricing for 3-5 years with volume commitments
5. IP Protection: Clear agreements on process IP, especially with Chinese CMOs

Repurposing Opportunities via EXIM Lens:
- High-volume generic APIs (Metformin, Losartan) ideal for reformulation/repurposing
- Cost advantage: India-sourced APIs enable affordable repurposed products
- Supply security: Dual-sourcing ensures uninterrupted clinical trial supply
- Regulatory pathway: APIs already approved by FDA simplify 505(b)(2) filings
