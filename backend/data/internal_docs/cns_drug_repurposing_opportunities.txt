CNS Drug Repurposing Opportunities Assessment

Date: December 2024
Prepared by: Strategic R&D Planning Division

1. Landscape Summary
The CNS therapeutics market represents one of the highest unmet need areas in pharma:
- Alzheimer's Disease: $15B market, 95/100 unmet need score, recent FDA approvals (lecanemab, donanemab) validating amyloid hypothesis
- Parkinson's Disease: $8.2B market, growing 6% CAGR, motor symptom management well-served but non-motor symptoms underserved
- Major Depressive Disorder: $17B market, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is key unmet need
- Epilepsy: $7.5B market, 30% of patients are drug-resistant

2. Priority Repurposing Candidates

A. Metformin for Alzheimer's Disease
Evidence strength: HIGH
Key evidence:
- UK Biobank analysis (n=113,749): Metformin users had 35% lower dementia risk (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.73)
- Mechanism: AMPK activation → improved cerebral insulin signaling → reduced tau phosphorylation
- Phase 2 trial (NCT04098666 analog): 18-month study showed 15% slower cognitive decline (ADAS-Cog) vs placebo
- Neuroprotective effects via mitochondrial complex I inhibition
Target patient profile: Type 2 diabetes patients at risk for Alzheimer's — estimated 8M US patients
Market opportunity: $3-5B if prevention/delay indication achieved
Competitive position: First-mover advantage — no other repurposed drug in Phase 2 for AD
IP strategy: Method-of-use patent for combination with cholinesterase inhibitor
Recommendation: HIGHEST PRIORITY — advance to Phase 3

B. Losartan for Alzheimer's Disease
Evidence: MODERATE
Rationale: RAS pathway modulation; AT1 blockade reduces neuroinflammation and Aβ accumulation
Preclinical: 30% reduction in amyloid plaque load in APP/PS1 transgenic mice
Epidemiological: ARB users show 20% lower dementia incidence (multiple retrospective studies)
Limitations: No prospective clinical data specific to AD
Recommendation: Monitor ongoing academic trials; prepare for licensing if Phase 2 data emerges

C. Rapamycin for Parkinson's Disease
Evidence: LOW-MODERATE
Rationale: mTOR inhibition enhances autophagy → clearance of α-synuclein aggregates
Preclinical: Significant neuroprotection in MPTP and rotenone mouse models
Safety concern: Immunosuppression limits chronic use; need for CNS-selective formulation
Market: $2B opportunity for disease-modifying therapy (currently none approved for PD)
Recommendation: WATCH — invest only if CNS-targeted delivery technology becomes available

D. Ketamine/Esketamine Analogs for Treatment-Resistant Depression
Market status: Spravato (esketamine) approved but limited adoption due to REMS program
Opportunity: Oral ketamine formulations or novel glutamate modulators
Market gap: Oral formulation could capture $4B market by removing infusion requirement
Competitive landscape: Multiple companies pursuing (atai Life Sciences, Perception Neuroscience)
Recommendation: Evaluate licensing opportunities for oral formulations

3. CNS Drug Delivery Challenges
- Blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains the primary obstacle
- Emerging technologies: focused ultrasound BBB opening, nanoparticle carriers, intranasal delivery
- Strategic recommendation: Partner with BBB technology companies (Insightec, Denali Therapeutics)

4. Regulatory Considerations
- FDA increasingly accepting biomarker endpoints (amyloid PET, tau PET, NfL)
- Accelerated approval pathway available for serious conditions with unmet need
- Companion diagnostic requirement for some CNS programs

5. Investment Recommendation Summary
| Drug | Indication | Priority | Evidence | Investment ($M) | Timeline |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Metformin | Alzheimer's | HIGHEST | High | 45-60 | 3-5 years |
| Losartan | Alzheimer's | LOW | Moderate | 5-10 (monitor) | 5-7 years |
| Rapamycin | Parkinson's | WATCH | Low-Mod | 2-5 (research) | 7-10 years |
| Ketamine oral | TRD | MODERATE | High | 30-40 (license) | 2-3 years |
